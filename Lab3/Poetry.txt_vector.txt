 I cannot go to school today Said little Peggy Ann McKay I have the measles and the mumps A gash a rash and purple bumps My mouth is wet my throat is dry Im going blind in my right eye My tonsils are as big as rocks Ive counted sixteen chicken pox And theres one morethats seventeen And dont you think my face looks green My leg is cutmy eyes are blue It might be instamatic flu I cough and sneeze and gasp and choke Im sure that my left leg is broke My hip hurts when I move my chin My belly buttons caving in My back is wrenched my ankles sprained My pendix pains each time it rains My nose is cold my toes are numb I have a sliver in my thumb My neck is stiff my voice is weak I hardly whisper when I speak My tongue is filling up my mouth I think my hair is falling out My elbows bent my spine aint straight My temperature is oneoeight My brain is shrunk I cannot hear There is a hole inside my ear I have a hangnail and my heart iswhat Whats that Whats that you say You say today is  Saturday Gbye Im going out to play Everythings wrong Days are too long Sunshines too hot Wind is too strong Clouds are too fluffy Grass is too green Ground is too dusty Sheets are too clean Stars are too twinkly Moon is too high Waters too drippy Sand is too dry Rocks are too heavy Feathers too light Kids are too noisy Shoes are too tight Folks are too happy Singin their songs Why cant they see it Everythings wrong I wanna write lyrical but all I got is magical My book needs a poem talkin bout I remember when Something more autobiographical Mi familia wanted to assimilate nothing radical Each month was a struggle to pay our rent With food stamps so dust collects on the magical Each month it got a little less civil Isolation is a learned defense When all you wanna do is write lyrical None of us escaped being a criminal Of the state institutionalized when They found out all we had was magical White room is white room its all statistical Our calendars were divided by Sundays spent In visiting hours Cold metal chairs deny the lyrical I keep my genes in the sharp light of the celestial My history writes itself in sheets across my veins My parents believed in prayer I believed in magical Well at least I believed in curses biblical Or not I believed in sharp fists Beat myself into lyrical But we were each born into this anger so cosmical Or so I thought I wore ten chokers and a chain Couldnt see any significance anger is magical Fists to scissors to drugs to pills to fists again Did you know a poem can be both mythical and archeological I ignore the cataphysical and I anoint my own clavicle Why who makes much of a miracle As to me I know of nothing else but miracles Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water Or stand under trees in the woods Or talk by day with any one I love or sleep in the bed at night with any one I love Or sit at table at dinner with the rest Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car Or watch honeybees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon Or animals feeding in the fields Or birds or the wonderfulness of insects in the air Or the wonderfulness of the sundown or of stars shining so quiet and bright Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring These with the rest one and all are to me miracles The whole referring yet each distinct and in its place To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle Every cubic inch of space is a miracle Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same Every foot of the interior swarms with the same To me the sea is a continual miracle The fishes that swimthe rocksthe motion of the wavesthe ships with men in them What stranger miracles are there
